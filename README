Notes:

The first time you run ./triage.py, the script will have to authenticate with
google -- it will try to open a browser for this, otherwise you can use the
link it prints out manually.  Once this is done, a file named "calendar.dat"
will be written, containing authentication data.  After this, you should be
able to run the script non-interactively, ie, without browser assistance.
To force re-authentication, just remove "calendar.dat" .

There is also a "client_secrets.json", which google says you should keep
private, but in this case I think it's only the calendar.dat file that has
auth data for your google user, and I don't believe it's necessary to keep
the "client_secret" value in client_secrets.json a secret.  If at some point
we want to secure it though, project owners can make a new one and project
members can get it from here:

  https://console.developers.google.com/project/820929912154/apiui/credential

If you want to be added to the project, contact edquist@cs.wisc.edu, who can
set you up.  As I understand it though, what you really need is not to be a
member of the project, but to have access to the OSG Software calendar.
If you need write access to that, contact cat@cs.wisc.edu .

Note also that even without write access to the OSG Software calendar, you
can use this tool to manage triage assignments on your own personal calendar
by specifying "--calendarId primary" .
